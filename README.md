### About **Me** 🙋‍♂️

I'm a computer science
undergraduate at Missouri Science and Technology in Rolla Missouri. My area's of interest include **Machine Learning** 🤖, **Cybersecurity** 🔒, and **Game Development** 🕹️. I love programming, but outside of building a career for myself I can also be found **fishing** 🐟, **bowling** 🎳, **gaming** 👾, **reading** 📚, **lifting** 💪, and **hanging with friends** 😎.


I'm currently working on developing a game in Lua, enhancing my skills with Leetcode, Kattis, and NeetCode, and learing more about software design, machine learning, and game design. I'm also planning on doing some undergraduate research with my professors in the area of Cybersecurity.
