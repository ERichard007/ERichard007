**'Computer Science Undergraduate at MS&T'**

My name is Evan, I'm a computer science undergraduate at Missouri Science and Technology in Rolla Missouri. My area's of interest include Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and Game Development. Usually if I'm not reading a fiction book (The Witcher Series right now), playing the bass, bowling, fishing, or gaming, I'm programming. I'm currently working on developing a game in Lua, enhancing my skills with Leetcode, Kattis, and NeetCode, and learing more about software design, machine learning, and game design. I'm an entrepenuer at heart however and am always working with friends to figure out ways to do something new (which has currently just led to AI slop, 300 laptops, Stock algorithms, and Dropshipping). I'm also planning on doing some undergraduate research with my professors in the area of Cybersecurity.
